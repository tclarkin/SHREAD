# SHREAD Snow Data Product Aquisition and Processing Tool
SHREAD, the Snow-Hydrology Repo for Evaluation, Analysis, and Decision-making, is a tool for downloading, processing, and archiving snow data products, nominally to allow them to better support water management decision making. The tool is still in development, but currently provides access to the following products -
  * NOHRSC SNODAS Snow Water Equivalent (SWE)
  * NOHRSC SNODAS Fractional Snow-Covered Area (fSCA)
  * NOHRSC National Snow Analysis Snowfall Depth
  * NOHRSC Aggregated Station Snowfall Reports
  * NOHRSC Aggregated Station Snow Depth (SD) Reports
  * NOHRSC Aggregated Station Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) Reports
  * JPL MODSCAG MODIS-Derived Fractional Snow-Covered Area (fSCA)

Support for additional products is in development or planned, including -
  * NASA MODIS Fractional Snow-Covered Area (fSCA)
  * USGS Landsat Fractional Snow-Covered Area (fSCA)
  * ESA Sentinel-3 Snow Products
  * Theia Sentinel-3 Snow Products
