## SHREAD Documentation

The Snow-Hydrology Repo for Evaluation, Analysis, and Decision-making or SHREAD
is a snow data product aquisition and processing tool that provides access to
snow data products and related data products to support hydrologic research and
water management. The tool locally downloads datasets and consistently formats
data to allow for data intercomparison, visualization, and use in modeling tools.

SHREAD is a command-line tool written in Python. Inputs are provided by the user
at the command-line, and in a configuration file, to specify data products to
retrieve, data formatting, and desired output products.
